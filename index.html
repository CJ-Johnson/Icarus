  <p class="lead">Mental continuity</p>
  <p>Mental continuity is the idea that a small change how you think about your
  program ought to result in a small change in the code being written.</p>

  <p class="lead">Simplicity over uniformity</p>
  <p>The rules for a language should be simple. This is often achieved by
  applying the same rules uniformly in many situations. While this does
  generally simplify a language it can be taken too far.</p>

  <p class="lead">Simplicity over familiarity</p>
  <p>Simple does not mean familiar. We're not afraid to try something new if
  it's an improvement upon old. We trust that programmers are smart enough to
  pick it up quickly</p>

  <p class="lead">Concurrency</p>
  <p>A language without a good concurrency model cannot thrive in today's
  world.</p>
